# Fill 100 Game

Fill 100 squares game, made in JavaScript

## How it works

The game needs a 10x10 square, but you can choose any size. Every cell is filled with a number between 1 and 100 (or it depends on your custom size).

Filling the square is the hardest part, you need to follow one simple rule:

From the current filled square, you can move in any direction

- Horizontally and Vertically by 2 spaces (example: 1 x x 2)
- Diagonally by 1 space

You can start from any square, the goal, as I said, is to fill everyone of them.

The 10x10 is pretty difficult, I found a solution prefilling half of the square, then I created a script that tried to find a solution, and I know it exists.
